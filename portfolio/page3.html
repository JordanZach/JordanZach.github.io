    <div id="about-me">The following is a history slides project about the second world war. I created it in Mr. Smith's AP U.S. history class. Each slide contains information about the topic, and at least one image relating to the topic. The slides have been embeded into the website using an object tag, and they themselves are a pdf file. The topic of the project was chosen by my history teacher. Similarly the individual slide topics were also chosen by him along with the layout of the slides.
