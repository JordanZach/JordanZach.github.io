    <div id="about-me">The following is a physics project I created. It is an informational brochure on the dwarf planet Ceres. The slide lists multiple facts about Ceres and has diagrams/ pictures. This was created so that we could learn more about the solar system around us. I also created a slides project for the planet Mars and Jupiter's moon Europa. Both of these projects were in the same format but I chose to upload the one about Ceres because I thought that Ceres was relatively unknown, and needed to be seen more than Mars or Europa.
