    <div id="about-me">I have consistently had over a 3.0 GPA throughout all of my years of school. More recently, during my junior year of high 
    school I have been stepping up my effort and currently have a 4.17 GPA. I have been enrolled in the GATE program since elementary school, and I     have gone to multiple math field day events. In high school I have taken up coding through the school pathway program called the App Academy. The first picture is of dodger stadium were I was a junior dodger radio broad caster for a couple years. The second image is of the App Academy logo.</div>
