    <div id="about-me">The following pictures are screenshots from a racing game I made in App Academy. The game was 2-player, each player had a key assigned to their car and pressed it to make their car move. The first screenshot shows what happens when you first load the page (it prompts you for a username). The second shows a race happening. The final screen shot shows that when a player gets to the end it will display their username as the winner of the race. I created the project using socket.io which sends information to a server and the sends the requested information to all users. I also used the P5.js library which I used for animating the game.
